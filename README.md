# About app
This was a app I got from a course a took but I changed it to make it my own project and futher my software development skills. I add a server using node.js and firebase for the db. I only have one user since adding vans and picture wasn't the goal of the project. If you want to check what the host pages are the email is b@b.com and password is p123.
